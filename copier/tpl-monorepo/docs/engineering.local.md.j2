# engineering.local (monorepo root)

Primary model:

- Monorepo root is a control plane for shared docs, CI, ontology, and governance.
- Package/app members define language-specific engineering contracts inside their own folders.

Executable contract surface:

- root `policy/engineering-lane.json` declares the monorepo control-plane posture, catalog/list commands, and scanner-visible root disciplines
- root `docs/engineering.local.md` explains monorepo control-plane deltas
- package/app `policy/engineering-lane.json` declares the upstream `engineering-core` lane reference when one exists
- package/app `docs/engineering.local.md` records local overrides

Practical rule:

- Use root commands for monorepo-wide validation.
- Use package/app local checks for language-specific validation.
- Use each package/app `policy/engineering-lane.json` as the source of truth for the declared upstream lane command; root docs should not hardcode package lane commands.
- If a package/app lane ships a conditional `engineering-<lane>.ts-quality.md` addendum and that member adopts `ts-quality`, keep rollout truth in that member's docs surface (for example `docs/project/ts-quality-current-vs-target.md`) rather than duplicating the doctrine at the monorepo root.
