# Ontology Index (repo)

Start here when browsing manually.

- `ontology/manifest.yaml` — which layers apply
- `ontology/src/system4d.yaml` — repo-local System4D (implementation); replace its `FILL IN` values from the repo's own docs and code
- `ontology/src/reference/concepts/` — repo-local concepts (only when needed)
- `ontology/src/bridge/mapping.yaml` — map concepts to code symbols
- `ontology/dist/` — generated artifacts (tool-first)

Tip: use `./scripts/rocs.sh pack <concept_id> --repo .` instead of opening many files (the launcher resolves ref layers from the enclosing workspace; set `ROCS_WORKSPACE_ROOT` only when the repo lives outside it).
