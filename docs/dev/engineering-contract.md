# Engineering contract (L0 -> L1 -> L2)

This is the canonical document for how `engineering-core` should appear in generated repositories.

## Contract surface

When a repo or package maps to a shared `engineering-core` lane, prefer this explicit surface:

1. `policy/engineering-lane.json`
   - pins the upstream lane name
   - records the retrieval command
   - is the machine-readable contract
2. `docs/engineering.local.md`
   - records repo/package-local deltas on top of the upstream lane
   - is the human-readable local override
3. validation scripts
   - must at least verify pinned lane metadata
   - may optionally smoke the `engineering-core` CLI when available

## Layer rules

### L0 (`core/tpl-template-repo`)
- author the contract in template sources
- document the contract once, centrally
- keep fixtures in sync so drift is visible
- maintain a language/member matrix for stack-bearing archetypes:
  - `fixtures/matrix/tpl-project-repo/<language>/`
  - `fixtures/matrix/tpl-monorepo/root/` with language-varied generated members under `packages/`

### L1 (company template repos)
- inherit the L0 contract artifacts
- keep company-specific overrides minimal

### L2 (generated repos)
- project repos: add `policy/engineering-lane.json` + `docs/engineering.local.md` when a lane exists
- monorepos: root ships `docs/engineering.local.md`; generated members carry language-specific lane artifacts
- packages/apps: add `policy/engineering-lane.json` + `docs/engineering.local.md` when a lane exists

## Current lane mapping used in templates

- Python -> `py`
- TypeScript -> `ts`
- Node -> `ts` (closest shared lane until a dedicated node lane exists)
- Go -> `go`
- Rust -> `rust`
- Elixir -> `elixir`

## Downstream rollout rule

When propagating one affected file into downstream generated repos, use:
- `[[docs/dev/single-file-propagation-playbook.md]]`

Do not recopy whole repos casually for engineering-contract updates with large blast radius.

## Maintenance rule

When changing the engineering contract:
1. update the L0 template source files
2. update this doc if the contract meaning changes
3. refresh baseline fixtures and the language/member matrix
4. run L0 validation
