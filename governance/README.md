# Governance

Governance guidance for softwareco. The records themselves live in Agent Kernel (AK); this folder
holds program notes and exported snapshots.

## Where the records live

| Concern | Authority | Commands |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Tasks, single-repo or cross-repo | AK | `ak task create -r <repo> ...`, `ak task show <id>` |
| Direction | AK | `ak direction check`, `ak direction export` |
| Decisions | AK | `ak decision list`, `ak decision passport <id>` |
| Evidence | AK | `ak evidence ...` |
| Society-level coordination items | FCOS, the coordination board (Leitstand), in `holdingco/fcos-control-board/` | `fcos cockpit` |

- RFC and ADR files are projections of an AK decision, not the decision itself.
- FCOS records, screens and verifies coordination items; it never decides. FCOS and AK compose only
  through facts their owners issue (Decision 129).
- No repo keeps a checked-in `work-items.json` projection (Decision 127): not this folder, not
  `programs/`, not the L2 repos. If a repo still carries one from an older template, import it once with
  `ak work-items import`, continue with `ak task ...`, and delete the file.

## This folder

| Path | Holds |
|------|-------|
| `programs/` | Company-level program notes: scope, AK ids, dated results and closeouts (see `programs/README.md`) |
| `task-scopes/` | Frozen AK task-scope snapshots, only when a task needs explicit scope |

## Repo-local task-scope snapshots (AK-authored)

When a generated repo opts into explicit AK task scope:

- AK remains the authoring surface via `ak task scope show|set|update ...`
- repo-side consumers use frozen exports under `governance/task-scopes/AK-<TASK-ID>.snapshot.json`
- `ak task scope export <TASK-ID> > governance/task-scopes/AK-<TASK-ID>.snapshot.json` refreshes the checked-in snapshot
- `./scripts/check-task-scope-snapshots.sh` verifies checked-in snapshots against live AK state and repo ownership when snapshots are present
- missing snapshots remain acceptable while a task still inherits repo-default scope
- any hand-authored `governance/task-scopes/AK-*.json` file that is not an AK export is transitional scaffolding, not authoritative truth

## Brownfield migration boundary

If an existing generated repo still carries hand-authored `governance/task-scopes/AK-*.json` files:

- author/update explicit scope in AK first, then export `AK-<TASK-ID>.snapshot.json`
- keep the legacy `AK-*.json` file only as temporary compatibility fallback while the repo still depends on it
- remove legacy manifest authoring from workflow docs/handoffs once `./scripts/check-task-scope-snapshots.sh` passes
- if a task remains on repo-default scope, do not invent either file

See `docs/dev/task-scope-migration-playbook.md` for the template-side rollout path.

## Validation

Validate repo-local task-scope snapshots when they are checked in (`./scripts/ci/full.sh` runs it too):

```bash
./scripts/check-task-scope-snapshots.sh
```

## Template improvement proposals

See `tips/README.md`.

## Task states

Task state lives in AK (`ak task show <id>`). The `triage → queued → doing → review → done` machine in
`holdingco/governance-kernel/governance/fcos/state-machine.yaml` is historical: an input to FCOS's
archived evidence, not live task state.
