# Governance

Template governance layer for this company.

## Purpose

This folder contains company-level planning artifacts plus validation contracts.
Repo-local work-items in generated L2 project/monorepo repos are **AK-first** and only projected back into git.

| Folder | Purpose | Operational? |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `programs/` | Company-level work tracking | Planning only |
| `model-languages/` | Schema validation | Yes (CUE) |

## Three-Level Hierarchy

| Level | Scope | Location | Authority |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **L0** | Cross-company | governance-kernel/governance/programs/ | Yes (scheduler / FCOS) |
| **L1** | Company | this repo: governance/programs/ | Planning only |
| **L2** | Project / monorepo | repo/governance/work-items.json | Agent Kernel authoritative; JSON is the checked-in projection |

## Company-Level Programs

Programs are tracked in `programs/`:

```
programs/
└── template-setup/
    ├── work-items.json    # Milestones and issues
    └── README.md
```

### What Goes Here

- Template individualization for this company
- Repo bootstrapping (tpl-owned, tpl-contrib, tpl-infra)
- Company-specific compliance baseline

### What Does NOT Go Here

- Cross-company work → L0 (governance-kernel)
- Single-repo features → L2 repo-local AK work-items

## L2 repo-local work-items (AK-first)

Generated `tpl-project-repo` and `tpl-monorepo` repos treat repo-local work-items this way:

- live operational authority stays in Agent Kernel
- `governance/work-items.json` is a deterministic checked-in projection/mirror
- `ak work-items import` is the legacy JSON bootstrap path
- `ak work-items export` refreshes the checked-in projection
- `ak work-items check` is the drift gate used by repo CI

## Repo-local task-scope snapshots (AK-authored)

When a generated repo opts into explicit AK task scope:

- AK remains the authoring surface via `ak task scope show|set|update ...`
- repo-side consumers use frozen exports under `governance/task-scopes/AK-<TASK-ID>.snapshot.json`
- `ak task scope export <TASK-ID> > governance/task-scopes/AK-<TASK-ID>.snapshot.json` refreshes the checked-in snapshot
- `./scripts/check-task-scope-snapshots.sh` verifies checked-in snapshots against live AK state and repo ownership when snapshots are present
- missing snapshots remain acceptable while a task still inherits repo-default scope
- any hand-authored `governance/task-scopes/AK-*.json` file that is not an AK export is transitional scaffolding, not authoritative truth

## Brownfield migration boundary

If an existing generated repo still carries hand-authored `governance/task-scopes/AK-*.json` files:

- author/update explicit scope in AK first, then export `AK-<TASK-ID>.snapshot.json`
- keep the legacy `AK-*.json` file only as temporary compatibility fallback while the repo still depends on it
- remove legacy manifest authoring from workflow docs/handoffs once `./scripts/check-task-scope-snapshots.sh` passes
- if a task remains on repo-default scope, do not invent either file

See `docs/dev/task-scope-migration-playbook.md` for the template-side rollout path.

## Validation

Validate company-level program work-items against schema:

```bash
cue vet governance/programs/*/work-items.json governance/model-languages/contract/work-items.cue
```

Validate repo-local task-scope snapshots when they are checked in:

```bash
./scripts/check-task-scope-snapshots.sh
```

## TIP Review Process

See `governance/README.md` for TIP escalation paths.

## State Machine

All levels use the same 5-state machine:

```
triage → queued → doing → review → done
```

Defined in: `governance-kernel/governance/fcos/state-machine.yaml`
